# Challenge 1 - Karaoke needs words
It is your birthday ! (come on, just pretend!)
You're organizing a party with all your friends and you've decided that people will be singing.
Now, being the developer that you are, you won't use some cranky old book with songs to get the lyrics, you want a web app!
Not only an app, but a beautiful Single Web Page app that you can be proud of.

It so happen that the MusixMatch API (https://developer.musixmatch.com/documentation) has all the data you need.

Now, it's just about having an artist search bar, list of songs, ability to sort the songs by the number of lyrics they 
got, title, and duration. You will want of course to be able to display the song lyric themselves.
A nice bonus would be to minimize the number of calls your doing to the MusixMatch API, because we don't want to bother 
them while singing drunk...
