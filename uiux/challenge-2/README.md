# Challenge 2 - Journey to Kepler
It is the year 2548. We are now half way to Kepler 186-f.
We spend the last 430 years adapting to our dome, but all is not exactly perfect.
We have 2000 pioneers with us traveling, and our old 'Domy-Neon' application is crashing down daily

We need to prototype a new app. Since we did not upgrade anything from our departure in 2018, you'll have to use 
those 430 years old technologies. I know, how did those guy even live without the ZorgBlugFramework ?
No Idea.

Still, this app needs to be able to tackle the travelers life:
+ managing our water levels and the water collector output
+ managing our food levels and the food production farm output
+ managing the pioneers numbers and current birth authorization and allowing for projection of those number in the future
+ allowing pioneer to ask for a 'baby making authorization'
+ allow for the 'Habitat and Survival Management' departement to authorize or reject 'baby making authorization' demands

Our travelers are very picky and frustrated to use old technologies, so we need to make it seamless for them.
They heard of an old technology called 'responsive' and they find the name cute.
For sure they want it to work on their old mobile phones, with their old OSes.
Android and iOS it was called. Of course this app needs to run on all our terminal in the dome.
That means Chrome 64 and Firefox 58...

Also, they want to have everything in a single page. 
They hate when the browser spin and spin. 
And last, we better make that app fast and usable.
These travelers get pickier every generation and we have 7 of those still to go.
