# Challenge 3 - That's testy
We're cool, we're hype. We did our first React/Redux app. 
It's call conduit. It's cute.

You can signup, you can sign in.
User have profile, with their contribution listed, and their favorite article.
You can read the contributor article and favorite them and so on.

But something is missing. We can feel it.
It's as if we had nothing to guarantee the quality of our releases.
It's a sense of unease that grows with our code complexity.

Take this application, and please, please, choose the best tool, the best framework to ensure we can guarantee a 
constant seamless high-quality application to our users. We are especially wary because our designer like to change 
things a lot. So we need to be able to maintain both the feature, and the look, and in a continuously automated fashion 
please !
