# Challenge 3 - It is rocket science!
We were supposed to be on Mars 2 years ago.
Elon is not happy. We crashed it again.
We checked everything, and it was not the hardware.
Something must be wrong with our software. 

Top-notch coders sure, but overworked guaranteeing the future of human race. 
They are stuck in a vicious circle : 
they fix a bug here, a new one pops up on another system, they fix it, the first bug reappears.

Since you are not a rocket scientist and you don't really like physics so much, you promise Elon you would fix the 
building of the software.
Your plan is to make a system in which whatever the programmer do, they will be able to iteratively built a more stable 
system at each step. There is currently 3 sub-project, the booster, the stage 2 and the cargo.
For this to fly, those parts need to be stable separately, but also together!

Of course, to start those developers up, you need to show them how it's done.

Take the project attached, choose the best strategy to improve its quality and start implementing some example of how 
those rocket programmers need to write the rest.
