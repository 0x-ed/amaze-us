# Challenge 1 - Saving the cathedrals

Once upon a time was the kingdom of monolithic apps.
All the buildings where giant, tightly architected to reach as high as possible. 
Each tower touched the sky, a patch at a time. Their bridge and hallways hangin by all the threads and little hacks
accumulated during the years.

But a threat is looming...

The biggest of the biggest earthquake is about to unfold underneath.
From what your crazy mad scientists tell you, only the apps that have no patch and no hacks will survive.
Knowing the state of all those apps, only the house and shop will be left if you don't do something quickly.

But you're a Knight of ContainerD. You know you can save them all.
You just have to slice those monolith up in the right way.


These are the building you can save :

- https://github.com/xxfast/jaxrs-reminder-app
- https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-data-keyvalue-examples
- https://github.com/salesagility/SuiteCRM

Choose one, choose the orchestrator you want to use, and make it scale!
