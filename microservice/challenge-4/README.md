# Challenge 4 - The Mystery of the Cats

Discovery is upon us! The mystery has to be solved! 
After years of research, century of mysticism, we have it.

As you can see in our code (ThoseCats.scala), we built a perfect representation of cats.
Using this, we can now, at last, understand cat's mood. We are on mission. So should you!

First, let's simulate a thousand of those virtual cats.
One cat should be a job, we want to be able to observe them changing their mood.

Once that's done, we need to generate some statistics: average, median, variance of the different mood over time, anything 
that can help us pierce the secret.
This of course should scale orthogonally to the number of cats we are simulating, we don't want to end up with angry 
cats, right ?

Makes spark, solve the mystery!
