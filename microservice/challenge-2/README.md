# Challenge 2 - Save the humans
Humanity is in danger !
The AI are unleashed and going crazy and they now can now mimick real humans using cyborgs.
But they have a flaw, they can not resist leaving Amazon review with both the word 'Amazing' and 'human'.

You are our savior. 
We beg you to build a learning system that will train on the dataset you will find at http://jmcauley.ucsd.edu/data/amazon/ 
[the full dataset is here ](http://jmcauley.ucsd.edu/data/amazon/amazon_readme.txt).

But please, make sure we can make it scale. The robot population is growing like ants!
As we will need to share this with the United State nation, please not only build the system, but explain how it works 
and how we can reproduce your result!

Humanity will prevail!
