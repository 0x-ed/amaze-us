# Amaze us

Hello candidate !

We are very excited that you have elected to take on our technical challenge.

First, a little reminder that :
- you don't need to finish: it's better to have a few part that work than have brushed on everything but without any working 
software to demonstrate. 
If you feel frustrated about not having finished, why don't you just write down what your plan was for the next steps?

- you can choose whichever language and framework you think is most appropriate, we may have challenged you to choose one 
in particular, but you're a free human! Do what make most sense to you.

- don't be scared to experiment a bit, just let us know it's something knew for you, we'll be more generous with our assessment

- show off, we're here for that!

## Let's start
Depending on your application, you have been chosen for one of those challenge.
Please choose the one that match your application, otherwise we'll get confused and that make us sad :)

We should have discussed **_when_** we are expecting your submission.
By providing a Pull Request on github with your firstname-name as the branch name will be enough.
If you're going to be late, please let us know...

At the end of the process, _we will_ refuse your PR: don't take it as a bad sign. 
It just mean we want to keep our master branch clean and shiny. 
If you're proud of it and want to keep your code to yourself, we advise that you fork our repo instead of creating a 
branch, and make a PR out of your fork.

We'll get to you as soon as your Pull Request has been reviewed.
Hopefuly to tell you how amazing your code is!
